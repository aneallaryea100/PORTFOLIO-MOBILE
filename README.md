# PORTFOLIO-MOBILE
I am building  a mobile portfolio webpage by following figma template 2 design.

# Built With
* HTML AND CSS
* Figma


# Prerequisite
create a repository on github and clone it to my local environment. 
# STEPS I TOOK IN THIS PROJECT
* I created a branch(mobile-feature)
* I installed HTML & CSS linters in the mobile-feature branch.
* I created a HTML and CSS file.
* I went to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=1%3A1471) to clone the mobile version of the portfolio page.
# CODE REVIEWS
1. I had to fix the fonts in my logo name and also the text in my html.
2. I had to use <a> tags instead of <h1> tags for the logo name.
3. I had to use unodered list in my social media sections for proper listing.
4. I was asked to create a descriptive README.MD
